# Food Recipe Website (Project 1)

(Created late September 2023 and completed by early October 2023)

My first project on HTML, where I created a food recipe site for anyone to read about how to create the certain foods on the website! I created a default page, where it serves as the main page for the introduction and links for the other pages! On my first page, I created the breakfast recipe with an implementation of audio on how to create the food and an image of the food. On the second page, I created a lunch recipe that included motion from which I linked a YouTube video to show onto the page directly. Lastly, for the dinner page, I created the recipe and included an image of how the recipe should turn out! Enjoy viewing the page!

Here below are the directions I wrote if you'd like to view the website properly instead of having to download the code andd figuring out how to view it: 
1.) First, open a separate tab, and search/go to raw.githack.com.
2.) Secondly, use this link to copy and paste onto the middle search on raw.githack.com -> https://github.com/ronelkakos/Project-1-Food-Recipe-Site/blob/main/project1/default.html
3.) Third, under "Use this URL in production", click the small clipboard picture to copy the link.
4.) Then, open another separate tab and paste the link you copied from the clipboard under "Use this URL in production" onto your browser's search bar and click enter.
5.) Lastly, enjoy viewing my website!

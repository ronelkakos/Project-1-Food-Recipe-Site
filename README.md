# Food Recipe Website (Project 1)

(Created late September 2023 and completed by early October 2023)

My first project on HTML, where I created a food recipe site for anyone to read about how to create the certain foods on the website! I created a default page, where it serves as the main page for the introduction and links for the other pages! On my first page, I created the breakfast recipe with an implementation of audio on how to create the food and an image of the food. On the second page, I created a lunch recipe that included motion from which I linked a YouTube video to show onto the page directly. Lastly, for the dinner page, I created the recipe and included an image of how the recipe should turn out! Enjoy viewing the page!

To view the website easily and quickly without having to download files, here is a link I created to click below to an easy access in viewing my site through raw.githack.com.
